Future Updates:
Want to implement the load task feature to work in ties with a sign in feature
 that'll save tasks for the specified user.
 Want to still implement theme and a better reward system but may be a bit of a reach in the way I'm
 wanting to currently, but wip as well.
 Also working on GUI and currently don't have a set idea but want to make it visually pleasing and easy to understand
